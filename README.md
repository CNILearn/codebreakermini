# Full Stack .NET Development with ASP.NET Core, Microsoft Azure and .NET MAUI

This is a repository for learning creating services with ASP.NET Core and Microsoft Azure, and creating client applications. This repository contains a .NET MAUI client application accessing the service.

First, this repo was used with a one-day workshop at the [BASTA! conference](https://www.basta.net) in Frankfurt, Germany.

Technologies used:

* ASP.NET Core Minimal API
* EF Core
* Bicep scripts to create Azure resources
* GitHub actions for CI/CD
* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure Container Apps
* Azure Container Registry
* Azure App Configuration

If you're interested in helping with the bigger Codebreaker repository, let's get in contact. The bigger repository contains a bot which automatically plays games, a live service which makes use of SignalR for real-time communication, gRPC communication, and more. In some months this repo will be made public available as well. While you wait for it, enjoy this smaller one.
